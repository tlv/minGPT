Jane walked closer to the tree and saw that the powder was made of tiny green pieces. \n\n\"What is that Daddy?\" Jane asked. \n\n\"That's special powder, Jane,\" her daddy replied. \"Let's gather some of it together and take it home with us.\"\n\nSo Jane and her daddy started gathering the powder into a bucket. They filled the bucket up with the powder and started walking home. \n\nWhen they got home, Daddy asked Jane what she wanted to do with the green powder. \n\n\"Let's make a special cake with it,\" she said.\n\nSo, Jane and her daddy used the green powder to make a special cake. They cut it up and shared it between them. Jane smiled, as it was the yummiest cake she had ever tasted. \n\nThe end.",
